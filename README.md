### This information looks at a dataset from the New York City open 311. The data can be found at:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.csv
### Information in the dataset contains information regarding Motor Vehicle Crashes in New York City boroughs. The data in each row contains a separate occurence. There are 29 columns containing data related to each crash event such as location, cross street, type of vehicle. We will use this data to look at the number of deaths in each borough and see if there is a statistical difference. The information may be used to determine which borough may be having large numbers of deaths and then infer if there may be suggestions regarding safety or traffic flow that could be made.
